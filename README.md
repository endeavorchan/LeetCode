###hi guiyuan, yunxiao,

I think the best practice to polish programming skill is to learn from other's code. It would be appreciated if you guys can push your codes of problems on leetcode to this repository. We can learn from each other.

I will push my codes here.

If you would push a code, please mark the number of that problem in the commit comment.

Chen

Thanks.

##Updates

**I put my code written in C++ in the file CPP, the name of the file indicates the number of the problem in LeetCode**

Roses are <span style="color:red">red</span>, violets are <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
