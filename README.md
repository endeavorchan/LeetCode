###hi guiyuan, yunxiao,

I think the best practice to polish programming skill is to learn from other's code. It would be appreciated if you guys can push your codes of problems on leetcode to this repository. We can learn from each other.

I will push my codes here.

If you would push a code, please mark the number of that problem in the commit comment.

I'd like to introduce Ruiqi Liu to you guys. He was my class mate at NJU. He is also willing to share his code with us. Happy Hack on!!

Chen

Thanks.
